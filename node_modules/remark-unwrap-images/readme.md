[**remark**][remark] plugin to remove the wrapping paragraph for images.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-unwrap-images
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`.
Imagine section titles and URLs a bit longer though.

```markdown
![hi](there.png)
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var remark = require('remark')
var html = require('remark-html')
var unwrapImages = require('remark-unwrap-images')

remark()
  .use(unwrapImages)
  .use(html)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<img src="there.png" alt="hi">
```

## API

#### `remark().use(unwrapImages)`

Remove the wrapping paragraph for images.
Supports multiple images, white space around images, and images in links as
well.

## Security

Use of `remark-unwrap-images` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype]
([**hast**][hast]) or user content, it only removes some existing nodes, so
there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
